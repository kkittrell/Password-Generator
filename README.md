# Password-Generator-Homework

## Description

This password generator was very difficult for me. This was created as a project for my coding bootcamp. In its current state I have only been able to generate the string values as a whole but not split them randomly.


## Installation

No installation required. This project can be accessed from github pages or by going into the repo.

## Usage

This is still a work in progress and was intended to be able to generate random passwords based on user input to come up with a password on the screen the user could copy and use as a password if desired.
